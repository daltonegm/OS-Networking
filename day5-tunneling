ssh localhost -p 54321

the 356 key gets stored locally in ssh

once ive proven ssh works I can exit and 

why would I still want to logged in? recon

proxychains note at top

how many dymaic proxy chains can you have 1

ssh localhost -p 54321 -D 9050

ssh student 

scanned a box
only had port 22
try to log into telnet
find username password
defaults
sniff the network line
telnet in
when got in nettstat
port 22 was running on the inside
i can use ssh
i sshed to my internet host
for my tools
used remote port bind to open ssh on my internet host
pointed locally, passing thru the firewalls
went thru the tunnel

T3(10.50.29.96) is the authorized initial pivot
Conduct passive recon on the Target T3, it appears to have access to the 10.3.0.0/24 subnet.
Create a Local Port Forward from your Internet_Host to T3 targeting:
ip: 10.3.0.27
port: `HTTP``
Identify the flag on Victoria's HTTP Server
HINT: internet_host$ ssh netX_studentX@{T3_float_ip} -L NssXX:10.3.0.27:80 -NT
**ANSWER***
ssh net3_student1@10.50.29.96 -L 30101:10.3.0.27:80
*then on internet host firefox**
localhost:30101


2.
Create a Dynamic Port Forward from Internet_Host to T3 then use proxychains to pull the flag.
Target ip: 10.3.0.1
Identify the flag on Cortina's FTP Server
HINT: internet_host$ ssh netX_studentX@{T3_float_ip} -D 9050 -NT

ssh net3_student1@10.50.29.96 -D 9050
proxychains wget -r ftp://10.3.0.1
cat flag.txt 
You have accessed Cortina's FTP server. The flag is "If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait longer!"

3.
Access to T4 has been provided via telnet.
This is a Compromised host within Donovia
Leverage this internal access to act as an insider threat throughout this Grorgan Cyber Training Operation.
Conduct passive recon on this host and determine where the shared location for data relating to CCTC is on the machine.
